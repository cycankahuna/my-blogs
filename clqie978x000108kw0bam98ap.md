## **Introduction to EC2 Pricing Models**

**EC2 Pricing Models: üíµ** Amazon EC2 offers flexible pricing models to meet diverse workload requirements. Today, we'll explore three main pricing models: On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.

## **Getting Started**

### **Step 1: Understand On-Demand Instances**

1. Read the [**EC2 Pricing Documentation**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/).
    
2. Familiarize yourself with On-Demand Instances and how they are billed.
    

### **Step 2: Explore Reserved Instances (RIs)**

1. Visit the [**Reserved Instances Documentation**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/).
    
2. Understand the concept of Reserved Instances, including types and benefits.
    

### **Real-World Industry Example: Cost-Effective Application Hosting üåêüí∏**

Imagine you're architecting a cost-effective solution for hosting a business application.

* **Scenario:**
    
    * **Requirement:** Host an application with consistent usage.
        
    * **Solution:** Use Reserved Instances for baseline capacity and On-Demand Instances for additional capacity during peak times.
        
    * **Benefit:** Significant cost savings compared to running all instances as On-Demand.
        

## **Hands-On Practice: Exploring EC2 Pricing Models**

### **Step 3: Launch On-Demand and Reserved Instances**

1. In the [**EC2 Dashboard**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), click "Launch Instance."
    
2. Compare the pricing details for On-Demand and Reserved Instances.
    
    * Use the "Purchase Reserved Instances" wizard to reserve capacity.
        

### **Step 4: Understand Spot Instances**

1. Read the [**Spot Instances Documentation**](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/).
    
2. Learn about Spot Instances, which allow you to bid for unused EC2 capacity at potentially lower costs.
    

### **Step 5: Launch a Spot Instance**

1. In the EC2 Dashboard, click "Launch Instance."
    
2. Choose "Request Spot Instances" and configure your Spot Instance.
    
    * Set your bid price and configure other instance settings.
        

## **Conclusion**

Congratulations on completing Part 7 of our AWS Solutions Architect journey! Today, you've explored the various pricing models of Amazon EC2, including On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances. Understanding these models is crucial for optimizing costs and designing cost-effective architectures on AWS. Tomorrow, we'll dive into Auto Scaling to ensure our applications can handle varying workloads effectively. Get ready for more AWS insights! üöÄüíª
