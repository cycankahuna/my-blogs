In the early 2000s, as the e-commerce giant [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) was experiencing rapid growth, its internal infrastructure faced increasing demands. Facing challenges in managing their vast computing resources efficiently, Amazon's engineers began exploring solutions to improve scalability and reduce operational overhead. This marked the inception of what would later become Amazon Web Services (AWS).  
Around 2002, Amazon's visionary founder, Jeff Bezos, initiated the development of a service-oriented architecture within the company. This laid the groundwork for the eventual launch of AWS. The team responsible for this initiative, led by Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black, envisioned creating a platform where computing power could be abstracted and provided as a utility.  
By 2003, the company had a working prototype of what would become AWS. In 2004, realizing the potential beyond internal use, they officially began developing the commercial version. This ambitious project was kept under wraps, known as "Project Genesis." The following years saw intensive development, testing, and refinement.  
The turning point came in 2006 when Amazon Web Services was officially launched to the public, offering a suite of web services, including computing power, storage, and database services. This marked the beginning of cloud computing as we know it today.
